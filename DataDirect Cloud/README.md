5. Click on the data store that you want to use, and it should now open a new view where you can configure connection to your data source like Datasource name(Unique name for the connection), hostname, port, username, password etc,. Below is an example screenshot of how configuration page of Salesforce looks like. The configuration attributes may vary depending on the data source that you have selected.

### Configuring OData for Datasource

7. Once you have successfully connected, click on the "OData" tab beside the "General" tab to configure the OData feed. Below is the screenshot, in case you weren't able to find it.

8. Click on "Configure Schema" and you should see a new view that asks you to select schema. Select the schema that you want to enable the OData. On Select, you will see a new view where it shows all the tables that you have in your data source as shown below in the screenshot.

9. You can select all the tables or select the tables that you want to access through OData. If a table doesn't have a Primary key defined on it, you have to select a column/group of columns that can be Primary key for that table. Without Primary key for a table OData will not be enabled for that table. 

10. After you have selected, just click on "Save&Close" button on top-right corner of the view which will validate your selection and saves it if everything is good.

11. You should now be back on the OData Tab, where you can find OData Access URI end point. Copy that and keep it aside.

12. Click on the "Save" button on top-right corner which saves all of your configuration for the datasource.

###Testing your OData URI endpoint

13. If you don't have Postman, you can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en">download</a> it from Chrome store.

14. Open Postman and paste the OData Access URI for your datasource in address bar. 

15. Under Authorization tab select "Basic Authentication" and provide your DataDirect Cloud username and password. Now click on "Update Request" button to update the request. 

16. Click on send and you should see the entity names that you have selected when you configured OData in DataDirect Cloud dashboard. Following is a screenshot of Postman that illustrates how you should configure and how the response looks like for a Salesforce datasource that I have configured.
