##Introduction

<p align="justify">Amazon Echo is a voice controlled speaker using which you can ask for news, play music, control your smart home devices etc. All of this is possible due to the Alexa voice service which provides skills or capabilities for the Alexa enabled devices so that users can interact with and get their work done. With that in context, Any developer can develop a custom skill for Alexa voice service which adds capabilities that it doesn't have by default. If you are interested in developing a skill for Alexa for the hackathon, making the best use of OData REST API then the following section serves as a getting started guide for you.</p>
